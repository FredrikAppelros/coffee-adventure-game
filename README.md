# Game

![](screenshot.png)

This is to be a laboration for an introductory programming course. It has yet to be deconstructed and divided into exercises.

All exercises will be using [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) and [Less](http://lesscss.org/).

This particular exercise contains free assets from [Glitch](http://www.glitchthegame.com/), [Game Art 2D](http://www.gameart2d.com/) and [Freesound](http://www.freesound.org/), as well as the font [04b-19](http://www.04.jp.org/).

The actual sounds being used are found here:

 * [Flapping sound](http://www.freesound.org/people/ani_music/sounds/244981/)
 * [Collision sound](http://www.freesound.org/people/BristolStories/sounds/46136/)

## Installation

First of all, [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) needs to be installed. Using npm, install [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) globally:

```
npm install -g gulp
```

Now the local packages needs to be installed; run the following:

```
npm install
```

## Usage

Now that the development environment is installed, using it is as simple as running gulp:

```
gulp
```

Gulp will now watch for changes to your files and automatically compile and minify your code and update your browser for you.
